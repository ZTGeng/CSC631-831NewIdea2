         * - byte whenExhaustedAction - specifies the behavior of the
         * borrowObject() method when the pool is exhausted; default is BLOCK;
         * - maxWait - how long (milliseconds) will the pool block the request
         * for new connection if pool is exhausted; if non-positive value given, blocks
         * indefinitely; default value -1;
         * - testOnBorrow - will or will not the pool attempt to validate each
         * object before it is returned from the borrowObject() method

         * object before it is returned to the pool in the returnObject(java.lang.Object) method
