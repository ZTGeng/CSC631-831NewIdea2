// List of methods (excluding constructor):
// - createRace - create record in DB for a new race
// - createPlayerRecord - create record for player data in race (x_pos, y_pos, etc.)
// - setPlayerSpecies - write player's selected species to DB
// - updateRace - update data (x_pos, y_pos, etc.) in DB of player during race
// - finishRace - update account data (experience, currency, etc.) in DB of player when finishing race
// - leaveRace - update data, remove records of race and player in DB when player leaves
